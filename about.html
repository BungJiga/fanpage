  <h1 style="text-align:center;font-size: 40px;">Doctor Who In A Nutshell</h1>
  <hr>
  <h1 style="font-size:30px;">What is Doctor Who?</h1>
  <p> Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord called "the Doctor", an extraterrestrial being, to all appearances human, from the planet Gallifrey. The Doctor explores the universe in a time-travelling space ship called the TARDIS. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by a number of companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes while working to save civilizations and help people in need.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:30px;">How many Doctors have there been?</h1>
  <p> This is a bit tricky to answer, because there have many different spin-offs of Doctor Who, and many of them used actors/Doctors different from those who appeared in the TV series (see Question 12, below). In principle, though, it is generally agreed that there are thirteen “official” Doctors: William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann, Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Matt Smith, Peter Capaldi and Jodie Whittaker. The Doctors are pictured below, in order from left to right (click on the image for a larger view). In addition, John Hurt portrayed an incarnation who fought during a terrible battle called the Time War, and who refused to think of himself as “the Doctor” due to the awful decisions he was forced to make.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:30px;">How long has Doctor Who been around?</h1>
  <p> The original Doctor Who series ran for twenty-six seasons of various lengths -- encompassing more than one hundred and fifty stories and over five hundred episodes -- before its run finally came to an end in December 1989. Despite this, in November 1993 a brief two-part made-for-charity story aired, reuniting many past castmembers to celebrate Doctor Who's thirtieth anniversary. Then, in May 1996, an original TV movie aired on both the BBC and the FOX network in North America. It was hoped that this would lead to a new ongoing series, but this did not come to pass. In September 2003, however, the BBC announced that they were developing a new Doctor Who series, picking up where the original left off. This premiered in March 2005 and is still running.</p>

<hr>
  <h1 style="font-size:30px;">How can I watch Doctor Who today?</h1>
  <p> The new Doctor Who series can be seen on BBC1 in the UK, Space in Canada, BBC America in the US, Prime Television in New Zealand, ABC in Australia, and several other channels internationally. Both the original series and earlier episodes of the new series also continue to be rerun in some locations. This Week In Doctor Who maintains an updated list of Doctor Who broadcasts. Most Doctor Who adventures are now available on DVD/Blu-ray, in both NTSC format (for North America) and PAL format (for most other viewers).</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:30px;">Where do I start?!?</h1>
  <p> With hundreds of episodes to choose from, getting into Doctor Who can be a little intimidating. But the truth is that most episodes are pretty self-contained -- especially if you're armed with the information in this Beginner's Guide. Still, there are some stories that are particularly good jump-on points. The introduction of pretty much any Doctor can be a good choice: you could start with the very first episode (100,000 BC), or the first colour episode (Spearhead From Space), or the first episode of the longest-serving Doctor (Robot). If you're wary of sampling television from the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties, you could start with the first episode of the current century (Rose) or the first episode of the current decade (The Eleventh Hour). Even the first episode of the most recent season (The Pilot) was designed specifically to appeal to new viewers. Or you could just try one of the best-regarded stories from a Doctor of your choice.
